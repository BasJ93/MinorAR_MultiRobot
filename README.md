# MinorAR_MultiRobot
:shipit:
#### Goals for the Minor AR Project:
- Decentralized control (maybe Swarm robots)                                                      (ROS, HWA, MBSE, POR, Vision)
- Safety                                                            (SAF)
- Unloading/Loading (Robot to Robot, Environment to Robot)          (ROS, HWA, MBSE, POR, Vision)
- Swarm might contain specialised robots                            (ROS, HWA, MBSE, POR, Vision)

## Goals this week:
- Concept research
- Swarm applied research
